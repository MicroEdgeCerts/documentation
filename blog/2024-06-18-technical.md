# Contract

Contract has IssuerRegistry and AchievementCredentialRegistry, each connect to the metadata. 

Idea of the architecting seperation between the contract and IPFS Meta files is 

that 

if you need the information for validation -> it will be in the contract 
Otherwise -> it will be in IPFS
